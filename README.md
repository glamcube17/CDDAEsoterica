* Anime trash
Content not rated by the ESRB.

## Installation

1. Place this directory (AndiMod) in cdda/data/mods.  
2. When creating a world, add Esoterica to the list of enabled mods.

## Requirements

Some content requires the game to be compiled with Lua support. If you would rather use this mod without Lua support, all .lua files may be safely deleted without impacting the remainder of the content.

## Compatibility

Usable for Linux, Windows, and MacOS experimental builds of Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

Compatible with most other CDDA mods.

Additionally, there is some limited integration with the following mods:  
* Battle Maid Redux
This is not a dependency; integration is primarily in the form of including items from other mods in recipes.
