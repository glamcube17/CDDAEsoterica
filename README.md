A mod by AndiBanandi/glamcube17 for the game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead.

This mod adds various content to the game, including tools, equipment, books, recipes, and more. An effort is made to maintain game balance with all additions, though this is not a guarantee.



## Installation

1. Place this directory (AndiMod) in cdda/data/mods.
2. When creating a world, add Esoterica to the list of enabled mods.

## Requirements

Some content requires the game to be compiled with Lua support. If you would rather use this mod without Lua support, all .lua files may be safely deleted without impacting the remainder of the content.

## Compatibility

This mod should be compatible with most other mods.
Additionally, there is some limited integration with the following:
-Battle Maid Redux
This is not a dependency; integration is primarily in the form of including items from other mods in recipes.
